UQLM is a Python library for Large Language Model (LLM) hallucination detection using state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification techniques. 

## Installation
The latest version can be installed from PyPI:

```bash
pip install uqlm
```

## Hallucination Detection
UQLM provides a suite of response-level scorers for quantifying the uncertainty of Large Language Model (LLM) outputs. Each scorer returns a confidence score between 0 and 1, where higher scores indicate a lower likelihood of errors or hallucinations.  We categorize these scorers into different types:



| Scorer Type            | Added Latency                                      | Added Cost                               | Compatibility                                             | Off-the-Shelf / Effort                                  |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| [Black-Box Scorers](#black-box-scorers-consistency-based)      | ⏱️ Medium-High (multiple generations & comparisons)           | 💸 High (multiple LLM calls)             | 🌍 Universal (works with any LLM)                         | ✅ Off-the-shelf |
| [White-Box Scorers](#white-box-scorers-token-probability-based)      | ⚡ Minimal\* (token probabilities already returned)   | ✔️ None\* (no extra LLM calls)             | 🔒 Limited (requires access to token probabilities)       | ✅ Off-the-shelf            |
| [LLM-as-a-Judge Scorers](#llm-as-a-judge-scorers) | ⏳ Low-Medium (additional judge calls add latency)    | 💵 Low-High (depends on number of judges)| 🌍 Universal (any LLM can serve as judge)                     |✅  Off-the-shelf        |
| [Ensemble Scorers](#ensemble-scorers)       | 🔀 Flexible (combines various scorers)       | 🔀 Flexible (combines various scorers)      | 🔀 Flexible (combines various scorers)                    | ✅  Off-the-shelf (beginner-friendly); 🛠️ Can be tuned (best for advanced users)    |
| [Long-Text Scorers](#long-text-scorers-claim-level)        | ⏱️ High-Very high (multiple generations & claim-level comparisons)       | 💸 High (multiple LLM calls)      | 🌍 Universal               | ✅ Off-the-shelf    |


<sup><sup> \*Does not apply to multi-generation white-box scorers, which have higher cost and latency. </sup></sup>

Below we provide illustrative code snippets and details about available scorers for each type.

### Black-Box Scorers (Consistency-Based)

These scorers assess uncertainty by measuring the consistency of multiple responses generated from the same prompt. They are compatible with any LLM, intuitive to use, and don't require access to internal model states or token probabilities.

<p align="center">
  <picture>
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="assets/images/black_box_graphic_dark.png">
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="assets/images/black_box_graphic.png">
    <img src="assets/images/black_box_graphic.png" alt="Black Box Graphic" />
  </picture>
</p>

**Example Usage:**
Below is a sample of code illustrating how to use the `BlackBoxUQ` class to conduct hallucination detection.

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")

from uqlm import BlackBoxUQ
bbuq = BlackBoxUQ(llm=llm, scorers=["semantic_negentropy"], use_best=True)

results = await bbuq.generate_and_score(prompts=prompts, num_responses=5)
results.to_df()
```
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cvs-health/uqlm/main/assets/images/black_box_output4.png" />
</p>

Above, `use_best=True` implements mitigation so that the uncertainty-minimized responses is selected. Note that although we use `ChatOpenAI` in this example, any [LangChain Chat Model](https://js.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/) may be used. For a more detailed demo, refer to our [Black-Box UQ Demo](./examples/black_box_demo.ipynb). 


**Available Scorers:**

*   Discrete Semantic Entropy ([Farquhar et al., 2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07421-0); [Bouchard & Chauhan, 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19254))
*   Number of Semantic Sets ([Lin et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19187); [Vashurin et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15627); [Kuhn et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.09664))
*   Non-Contradiction Probability ([Chen & Mueller, 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16175); [Lin et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19187); [Manakul et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08896))
*   Entailment Probability ([Chen & Mueller, 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16175); [Lin et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19187); [Manakul et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08896))
*   Exact Match ([Cole et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14613); [Chen & Mueller, 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16175))
*   BERTScore ([Manakul et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08896); [Zheng et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09675))
*   Cosine Similarity ([Shorinwa et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05563))
*   Code-adapted scorers via [`CodeGenUQ`](#code-generation-uq).

### White-Box Scorers (Token-Probability-Based)

These scorers leverage token probabilities to estimate uncertainty.  They offer single-generation scoring, which is significantly faster and cheaper than black-box methods, but require access to the LLM's internal probabilities, meaning they are not necessarily compatible with all LLMs/APIs.

<p align="center">

    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="assets/images/white_box_graphic_dark.png">
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="assets/images/white_box_graphic.png">
    <img src="assets/images/white_box_graphic.png" alt="White Box Graphic"/>
  </picture>
</p>

**Example Usage:**
Below is a sample of code illustrating how to use the `WhiteBoxUQ` class to conduct hallucination detection. 

```python
from langchain_google_vertexai import ChatVertexAI
llm = ChatVertexAI(model='gemini-2.5-pro')

from uqlm import WhiteBoxUQ
wbuq = WhiteBoxUQ(llm=llm, scorers=["min_probability"])

results = await wbuq.generate_and_score(prompts=prompts)
results.to_df()
```
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cvs-health/uqlm/main/assets/images/white_box_output2.png" />
</p>

Again, any [LangChain Chat Model](https://js.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/) may be used in place of `ChatVertexAI`. For more detailed examples, refer to our demo notebooks on [Single-Generation White-Box UQ](https://github.com/cvs-health/uqlm/blob/main/examples/white_box_single_generation_demo.ipynb) and/or [Multi-Generation White-Box UQ](https://github.com/cvs-health/uqlm/blob/main/examples/white_box_multi_generation_demo.ipynb).

*   Semantic Density ([Qiu et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13845))

### LLM-as-a-Judge Scorers

These scorers use one or more LLMs to evaluate the reliability of the original LLM's response.  They offer high customizability through prompt engineering and the choice of judge LLM(s).

<p align="center">
  <picture>
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="assets/images/judges_graphic_dark.png">
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="assets/images/judges_graphic.png">
    <img src="assets/images/judges_graphic.png" alt="Judges Graphic" />
  </picture>
</p>

**Example Usage:**
Below is a sample of code illustrating how to use the `LLMPanel` class to conduct hallucination detection using a panel of LLM judges. 

```python
from langchain_ollama import ChatOllama
llama = ChatOllama(model="llama3")
mistral = ChatOllama(model="mistral")
qwen = ChatOllama(model="qwen3")

from uqlm import LLMPanel
panel = LLMPanel(llm=llama, judges=[llama, mistral, qwen])

results = await panel.generate_and_score(prompts=prompts)
results.to_df()
```
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cvs-health/uqlm/main/assets/images/panel_output2.png" />
</p>

Note that although we use `ChatOllama` in this example, we can use any [LangChain Chat Model](https://js.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/) as judges. For a more detailed demo illustrating how to customize a panel of LLM judges, refer to our [LLM-as-a-Judge Demo](./examples/judges_demo.ipynb).


**Available Scorers:**

*   Categorical LLM-as-a-Judge ([Manakul et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08896); [Chen & Mueller, 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16175); [Luo et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15621))
*   Continuous LLM-as-a-Judge ([Xiong et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13063))
*   Likert Scale LLM-as-a-Judge ([Bai et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.04181))
*   Panel of LLM Judges ([Verga et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18796))

### Ensemble Scorers

These combine multiple individual scorers via weighted averaging to produce more robust uncertainty estimates. They are highly customizable for specific use cases and can be used off-the-shelf with fixed weights (unsupervised) or trained for optimal performance (supervised). The following workflow demonstrates the supervised training process. 

<p align="center">
  <picture>
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="assets/images/uqensemble_generate_score_dark.png">
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="assets/images/uqensemble_generate_score.png">
    <img src="assets/images/uqensemble_generate_score.png" alt="Uqensemble Generate Score" />
  </picture>
</p>

**Example Usage:**
Below is a sample of code illustrating how to use the `UQEnsemble` class to conduct hallucination detection. 

```python
from langchain_openai import AzureChatOpenAI
llm = AzureChatOpenAI(deployment_name="gpt-4o", openai_api_type="azure", openai_api_version="2024-12-01-preview")

from uqlm import UQEnsemble
## ---Option 1: Off-the-Shelf Ensemble---
# uqe = UQEnsemble(llm=llm)
# results = await uqe.generate_and_score(prompts=prompts, num_responses=5)

## ---Option 2: Tuned Ensemble---
scorers = [ # specify which scorers to include
    "exact_match", "noncontradiction", # black-box scorers
    "min_probability", # white-box scorer
    llm # use same LLM as a judge
]
uqe = UQEnsemble(llm=llm, scorers=scorers)

# Tune on tuning prompts with provided ground truth answers
tune_results = await uqe.tune(
    prompts=tuning_prompts, ground_truth_answers=ground_truth_answers
)
# ensemble is now tuned - generate responses on new prompts
results = await uqe.generate_and_score(prompts=prompts)
results.to_df()
```
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cvs-health/uqlm/main/assets/images/uqensemble_output2.png" />
</p>

As with the other examples, any [LangChain Chat Model](https://js.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/) may be used in place of `AzureChatOpenAI`. For more detailed demos, refer to our [Off-the-Shelf Ensemble Demo](./examples/ensemble_off_the_shelf_demo.ipynb) (quick start) or our [Ensemble Tuning Demo](./examples/ensemble_tuning_demo.ipynb) (advanced).


**Available Scorers:**

*   BS Detector ([Chen & Mueller, 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16175))
*   Supervised UQ Ensemble ([Bouchard & Chauhan, 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19254))


### Long-Text Scorers (Claim-Level)

These scorers take a fine-grained approach and score confidence/uncertainty at the claim or sentence level. An extension of [black-box scorers](#black-box-scorers-consistency-based), long-text scorers sample multiple responses to the same prompt, decompose the original response into claims or sentences, and evaluate consistency of each original claim/sentence with the sampled responses.

<p align="center">
  <picture>
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="assets/images/luq_example_dark.png">
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="assets/images/luq_example.png">
    <img src="assets/images/luq_example.png" alt="LUQ Graphic" />
  </picture>
</p>

After scoring claims in the response, the response can be refined by removing claims with confidence scores less than a specified threshold and reconstructing the response from the retained claims. This approach allows for improved factual precision of long-text generations. 

<p align="center">
  <picture>
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="assets/images/uad_graphic_dark.png">
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="assets/images/uad_graphic.png">
    <img src="assets/images/uad_graphic.png" alt="UAD Graphic" />
  </picture>
</p>

**Example Usage:**
Below is a sample of code illustrating how to use the `LongTextUQ` class to conduct claim-level hallucination detection and uncertainty-aware response refinement.

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o")

from uqlm import LongTextUQ
luq = LongTextUQ(llm=llm, scorers=["entailment"], response_refinement=True)

results = await luq.generate_and_score(prompts=prompts, num_responses=5)
results_df = results.to_df()
results_df

# Preview the data for a specific claim in the first response
# results_df["claims_data"][0][0]
# Output:
# {
#   'claim': 'Suthida Bajrasudhabimalalakshana was born on June 3, 1978.',
#   'removed': False,
#   'entailment': 0.9548099517822266
# }
```
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cvs-health/uqlm/develop/assets/images/long_text_output.png" />
</p>

Above `response` and `entailment` reflect the original response and response-level confidence score, while `refined_response` and `refined_entailment` are the corresponding values after response refinement. The `claims_data` column includes granular data for each response, including claims, claim-level confidence scores, and whether each claim is retained in the response refinement process. We use `ChatOpenAI` in this example, any [LangChain Chat Model](https://js.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/) may be used. For a more detailed demo, refer to our [Long-Text UQ Demo](./examples/long_text_uq_demo.ipynb).


**Available Scorers:**

*   LUQ scorers ([Zhang et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20279); [Zhang et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13246))
*   Graph-based scorers ([Jiang et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20783))
*   Generalized long-form semantic entropy ([Farquhar et al., 2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07421-0))


### Code Generation UQ

For code-generation tasks, UQLM provides `CodeGenUQ`, a specialized interface for predicting whether LLM-generated code is functionally correct without requiring execution. `CodeGenUQ` includes white-box scorers, code-adapted black-box scorers based on functional equivalence, and reflexive self-evaluation scorers. The white-box methods are the same token-probability-based scorers available through `WhiteBoxUQ`. 

**Example Usage:**

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")

from uqlm import CodeGenUQ
cguq = CodeGenUQ(
    llm=llm,
    scorers=["functional_equivalence_rate"]
)

results = await cguq.generate_and_score(prompts=prompts, num_responses=5)
results.to_df()
```

For a more detailed demo, refer to our [`CodeGenUQ` Demo](./examples/codegen_demo.ipynb). More details on code generation scorers are available in [Bouchard et al., 2026](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.28500).
