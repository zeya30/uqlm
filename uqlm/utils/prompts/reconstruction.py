    Task: You are provided with a list of facts about prompt. Your
    goal is to synthesize these facts into a coherent paragraph. Use
    all the provided facts where possible, ensuring that no fact is
    misrepresented or overlooked. If there are redundant facts, choose
    the most comprehensive one for inclusion. The length of the paragraph
    should naturally reflect the number of provided facts—shorter for
    fewer facts and longer for more. Avoid unnecessary filler and focus
    on presenting the information clearly and concisely.
